# Portunus

## Overview
This repo implements a secure API key proxy system with two main components:
- **Proxy**: Envoy-based reverse proxy that forwards API requests
- **Portunus**: FastAPI service that handles API key management, authorization, and Redis-based caching

## Key Functionality
- Securely retrieve API keys from AWS Secrets Manager
- Transparently proxy requests to third-party APIs (like OpenAI)
- Log request and response data for auditing and monitoring
- Configurable rate limiting at the proxy level
- Caching of authorization responses to improve performance
- TLS support for secure communications
- Request ID tracking throughout the system
- Principal identity tracking for audit purposes

## Detailed Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. Client makes request with a special authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <base64-encoded-payload>`
   - The payload contains AWS credentials and a secret ARN
   - Format: `API_KEY_PREFIX + base64(json({"credentials": {...}, "secret_arn": "..."}))`
   - This can be generated using `api_key_override()` in `util.py` which takes a secret ARN in format `aws-secretsmanager://<secret-arn>` and returns the encoded payload
2. Envoy proxy intercepts the request via Lua script (`lua.lua`)
   - Extracts the `Authorization` header
   - Removes the Bearer prefix from the payload
   - Makes a synchronous call to `/authorise` endpoint
   - Passes the extracted payload in the request body: `{"authorization": "<payload>"}`
3. Portunus (`app.py` → `services.auth_service` → `AuthService.get_api_key_from_payload`):
   - Checks Redis cache first (keyed by SHA-256 of payload)
   - If cached, returns stored API key immediately (faster responses)
   - If not cached, proceeds with full authentication:
   - Takes the raw payload (already without the Bearer prefix)
   - Decodes base64 payload using `decode_payload`
   - Extracts AWS credentials and secret ARN
   - Creates AWS session with provided credentials
   - Retrieves the secret from AWS Secrets Manager and parses it (`services.secret_validation_service.parse_secret`): plaintext or `{"secret", "host"}` is a stored key; `{"type": "anthropic_wif", ...}` or `{"type": "openai_wif", ...}` describes a token to mint
   - For mint secrets, `services.federation_service.TokenMintService` checks the federation role ARN is in `FEDERATION_ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_IDS` and under `FEDERATION_ROLE_PATH_PREFIX` (any path depth) and assumes exactly that role with the caller's credentials (regional STS endpoint). `anthropic_wif`: issues an STS web identity token from that session and exchanges it at `https://<host>/v1/oauth/token`. `openai_wif`: issues an ES384-signed STS web identity token and exchanges it at `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token` (RFC 8693 token exchange with the secret's `identity_provider_id` and `service_account_id`). Either way the result carries `output_header="authorization"`, `output_prefix="Bearer "`. Concurrent misses for one payload share a mint per process. STS or provider unavailability, or a missed 6 s mint deadline, raises `UpstreamServiceError` (503)
   - Caches the result: stored keys for `CACHE_DURATION`; minted tokens for min(`CACHE_DURATION`, token expiry - 1 min)
   - Publishes metadata (principal info) to Kinesis Data Streams for audit trail
   - Returns formatted API key with principal info
4. Proxy moves the credential into one upstream header
   - `portunus:apply_upstream_auth(request_handle, auth_response)` in `lua.lua`
   - The header is the response's optional `output_header` (else `API_KEY_HEADER`), the value is the optional `output_prefix` (else `API_KEY_PREFIX`) followed by the key
   - The inbound `API_KEY_HEADER` (which carries the caller's AWS credentials) is removed when it differs from that header; every other header is forwarded untouched
5. Proxy forwards the modified request to target API
6. Target API processes request using the real API key

### Logging Flow
1. Request logging:
   - Proxy captures request headers and body before forwarding
   - Makes async call to `/log` with metadata and type "request_headers", "request_body", or "request_trailers"
   - Payload is validated against appropriate Pydantic models (defined in `models.py`)
   - Binary data is base64-encoded by Lua before being sent to Portunus
   - Portunus publishes events directly to Kinesis Data Streams for long-term storage
2. Response logging:
   - After receiving upstream response, Lua captures response data
   - Makes async call to `/log` with metadata and type "response_headers", "response_chunk", or "response_trailers"
   - Each log event is typed based on its content (e.g., `ResponseChunkEvent` includes `chunk` and `index`)
   - Binary data is base64-encoded by Lua before being sent to Portunus
   - Portunus publishes events directly to Kinesis Data Streams for long-term storage
3. Metadata publishing:
   - Principal identity information is published to Kinesis during the authorization phase
   - All log events are published directly to separate Kinesis Data Streams (metadata, request headers/body/trailers, response headers/body/trailers)
   - No intermediate Redis storage is used for log data

A unique request ID is generated for each request and used to tie all logs together for traceability.

### Streaming Response Handling
The proxy is designed to handle streaming responses efficiently:
1. The proxy buffers the entire request body (configured up to 50 MiB) to authenticate it properly
2. Responses, however, are streamed directly to the client as they arrive
3. For streaming responses like SSE (Server-Sent Events), each chunk is logged individually with an index
4. Envoy's stream_idle_timeout is increased to 3600s to support long-running streaming responses
5. Response chunks are captured asynchronously to minimize impact on streaming performance

## Configuration

### Security Model
Portunus service endpoints (`/authorise`, `/log/*`, `/cache/flush`, WebSocket relay) do not authenticate callers. The proxy sends `PORTUNUS_API_KEY` in the `PORTUNUS_API_KEY_HEADER` header (default `x-api-key`) on every service call, but Portunus does not validate it — deployments must enforce access in front of the service (authenticating sidecar and/or network isolation). Documented in README "Security Model".

Logging captures full request/response bodies, headers, and trailers verbatim — everything except the headers that can carry a credential (`API_KEY_HEADER`, the upstream auth header, and every name in `KNOWN_AUTH_HEADERS`), which are dropped in Lua before logging. The WebSocket relay applies the same exclusions to logged upgrade headers. This is intentional (comprehensive audit trail); no secret redaction happens in Portunus. Any redaction/filtering/access-tiering is a downstream (ETL/query-layer) concern. Documented in README "Security Model" → "Logged data".

### Environment Variables
- `PORTUNUS_API_KEY`: Shared secret the proxy attaches to Portunus service calls (validated by the deployment layer, not by Portunus)
- `PORTUNUS_API_KEY_HEADER`: Header carrying the shared secret (default: "x-api-key")
- `API_KEY_HEADER`: Header name to use for API key (default: "authorization")
- `API_KEY_PREFIX`: Prefix for API key (default: "Bearer ")
- `KNOWN_AUTH_HEADERS`: Comma-separated header names excluded from header logging; does not affect forwarding (default: "authorization,x-api-key,x-goog-api-key,api-key")
- `RATE_LIMIT_PERCENT_ENABLED`: Enable rate limiting (0-100 percentage of traffic)
- `RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: Time window for rate limiting (seconds)
- `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_INTERVAL`: Maximum number of requests allowed per interval
- `RATE_LIMIT_PERCENT_ENABLED=0` disables rate limiting entirely
- When rate-limited, the proxy returns a 429 status code with an `x-{PORTUNUS_HEADER_PREFIX}-rate-limit: true` header (default prefix: `portunus`)
- `USE_TLS`, `USE_TLS_TARGET`, `USE_TLS_PROVIDER`, `USE_TLS_LISTENER`: TLS configuration
- `CACHE_DURATION`: How long to cache authorization responses
- `CACHE_INACTIVE`: Remove cache entries if unused for this period
- `REDIS_HOST`: Hostname for Redis server (used for authorization caching)
- `REDIS_PORT`: Port for Redis server (default: 6379)
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Password for Redis authentication
- `REDIS_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: Maximum number of Redis connections
- `FEDERATION_ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_IDS`: Comma-separated account IDs whose federation roles a mint secret may name (unset disables minting)
- `FEDERATION_ROLE_PATH_PREFIX`: IAM path federation role ARNs must start with (default: "/portunus-fed/")
- `FEDERATION_STS_ENDPOINT_URL`: STS endpoint for federation calls (default: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, else the regional endpoint)
- `FEDERATION_USER_TAG_KEY`, `FEDERATION_PRINCIPAL_TAG_KEY`, `FEDERATION_SESSION_TAG_KEY`, `FEDERATION_PROJECT_TAG_KEY`: Session tag keys on the identity token (defaults: "portunus:user", "portunus:principal", "portunus:session", "portunus:project")
